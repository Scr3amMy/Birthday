    <h2>❤️ What I will do for my Love Reshmi ❤️</h2>

    <p class="text">
        I’ve been thinking about you all day long but not in a way that tries to change your mind,
        but in a way that helps me understand why I went wrong.  
        You gave your patience, your care and your time in ways I didn’t always value the way I should have,
        and I am sorry for the times I hurt you.  

        I know I can’t undo what has already happened and I respect the space you need.
        More than anything that I want is for you to feel safe, respected and free to choose what is best for you.
        You mattered to me then and you still do but not as someone I want to pressure
        but as someone whose heart I never wanted to hurt.

        This would never not change the fact how much you actually mean to me and for that love how much am ready to take accountibility and change for my better self, this is not any promise or any statement its just what am gonna do and make you feel without ever asking anything in return just for you to be happy
    </p>

    <div id="learn" class="reveal">
        <p>• You weren’t asking for perfection but you were asking for my presence</p>
        <p>• You needed reassurance, not silence when things felt wrong</p>
        <p>• You weren’t overreacting you were reacting to feeling unheard</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Reveal 2 -->
    <button onclick="showHope()">What I hope for you 🌿</button>
    <div id="hope" class="reveal">
        <p>• Peace in your heart</p>
        <p>• Days that feel lighter than the ones you’ve carried</p>
        <p>• Happiness that doesn’t come with doubt</p>
