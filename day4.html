<h2>❤️ I Will Always Chose You ❤️</h2>

<p>
Somewhere in the way I realized something that I should have done much earlier. You kept choosing me even when I made it difficult.
You stay patient when I am lost, you cared when I push you away and you try again when I didn’t deserve another chance.
I know I’ve hurt you and I know I haven’t always met even the bare minimum you deserved. But  your effort, and your heart and your care and love for me has never been unnoticed.
In my life nothing ever make sense not even my existence but if there’s one thing I’m certain of is its being chosen by you. It has been one of the most meaningful things in my life and I still wanna be with u forever, have always wanted this.💖
